# Project Architecture

The architectural design of the **Rental Price Prediction** project emphasizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability, tailored for senior data scientists or MLOps engineers. Below are the key components:

---

## Configuration Management

- Centralized configuration is managed in the `config` module.
- Handles settings for:
  - Database.
  - Logging.
  - Model parameters.
- Environment-specific configurations are loaded from a `.env` file.

---

## Data Layer

- The `database` module encapsulates all data access logic.
- Utilizes **SQLAlchemy ORM** for data modeling and interactions.
- Provides an abstraction layer to decouple data handling from the rest of the application.

---

## Machine Learning Components

- The `ml` module is structured into the following sub-modules:
  - **`preprocessing`**: Handles data cleaning and transformation.
  - **`training`**: Focuses on model training and hyperparameter tuning.
  - **`inference`**: Supports predictions and real-time model usage.
- This modular design allows independent testing and deployment of each component.

---

## Containerization

- **Docker** is used for application containerization:
  - Image building.
  - Lifecycle management.
  - Continuous delivery.
  - Deployment strategies.

---

## API Design

- The `api` module focuses on:
  - API versioning for backward compatibility.
  - Comprehensive documentation.
  - Scalability of:
    - Maintenance APIs.
    - Inference APIs.
    - Security mechanisms.

---

## Monitoring and Observability

- Centralized logging is configured via the `config` module.
- Integrated metrics and monitoring systems to:
  - Track model performance.
  - Ensure system health.

---

## CI/CD Pipelines

- Automated pipelines ensure production-readiness with:
  - Build automation.
  - Testing.
  - Deployment.
- Includes:
  - Versioning.
  - Artifact management.
  - Robust deployment strategies.
