This Module is used for configuring the application's settings.

Setting Module is designed to handle the application's configuration and settings.
including model configuration , data file paths , model names , log levels ,
database connection string and table name. it's use Pydantic for validation
and management of the settings . the class is subclass of `BaseSettings`
from Pydantic. Which ensures type of validation and settings management.

Kay components:
    - model_config : Pydantic settings class for the model configuration for enviromnent
                    variables in `.env` loading and encoding using `SettingsConfigDict`
    - model_path : Directory path where the model is stored in the filesystem
    - model_name : Name of the model.
    - log_level : Loging level for the connection string.
    - db_conn_str : Database connections string.
    - rent_apart_table_name : Table name for rent apartment data.

Logging is handled by loguru, with settings configured to output logs to a file
and save them in a log file called "app.log" in the current directory.

Database connection string is used to connect to the database.
