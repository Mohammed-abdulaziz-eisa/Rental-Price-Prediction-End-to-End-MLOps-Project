"""
This module is responsible for loading data into our data pipeline, utilizing SQLAlchemy ORM for database interaction.

The primary function, `load_data_from_db`, extracts data from the specified database table and returns it as a pandas DataFrame.
The process involves constructing a query to select data from the `RentApartments` table and executing it through the SQLAlchemy engine.
The resulting data is then loaded into pandas for further analysis.

Logging is implemented with Loguru to track the data extraction process, providing insights into the operation's status and any potential issues.
