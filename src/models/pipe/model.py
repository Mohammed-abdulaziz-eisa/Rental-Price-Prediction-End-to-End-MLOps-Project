"""
This module is responsible for building and saving a machine learning model to predict rental prices.

The `build_model` function orchestrates the entire model building process, which includes:
1. Loading and preparing the dataset.
2. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. Training a Random Forest Regressor model with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
4. Evaluating the model's performance on the test set.
5. Saving the trained model as a pickle file for later use.

Logging is integrated with Loguru to track the model building process, providing insights into each step's status and potential issues.
